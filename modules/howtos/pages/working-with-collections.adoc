[abstract]
The 3.0 API SDKs all work with all features of Collections and Scopes.

The xref:{version-server}@server:learn:data/scopes-and-collections.adoc[Collections feature] in Couchbase Server 7.0 is fully implemented in the
3.0 API versions of the Couchbase SDKs.

NOTE: When working with earlier versions (before the Developer Preview in 6.5), or with other server versions, the `defaultcollection` is used from the SDK.
