The Couchbase .NET SDK is compatible with https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard[.NET Standard] 2.0 and .NET Standard 2.1, which means that it is compatible with .NET Framework 4.6.2+, .NET 5.0, .NET 6.0, and .NET Core 3.1.
The https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard[.NET Standard documentation] and
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/dotnet-standard#versions[.NET Standard version chart] may be useful to help understand other available options.
We strongly recommend using the latest version of .NET that is officially supported by Microsoft.
Other .NET implementations might work but are not tested and are outside of the scope for technical support.
